<h2>üìàTableau Visualization Breakdown</h2>
Break down average value per Free Trial by Region and analyze differences in values.

- Introduce and group by the additional dimension: `region`. Call the resultant table `cohort_value_by_month_and_region.

```bash
with free_trials_and_purchases as (
	select
            trials.trial_id
        ,	trials.free_trial_start_date
        ,	trials.region
        ,	purchases.purchase_date
        ,	purchases.purchase_value
    from trials
        left join purchases
            on purchases.trial_id = trials.trial_id
)

,	summary_by_month as (
    select
            date_trunc('month', free_trial_start_date) as month
    	,	region
        ,	count(*) as num_free_trials
        ,	count(purchase_date) as num_purchases
        ,	sum(purchase_value) as usd_value
    from free_trials_and_purchases
            group by 1, 2
)

select
		month
    ,	region
	,	num_free_trials
    ,	num_purchases
    ,	usd_value
    ,	(usd_value::float) / (nullif(num_free_trials, 0)::float) as cohort_value_per_free_trial
from summary_by_month
	order by 1, 2
```
